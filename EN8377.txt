✦ Elegy ✦
I opened the first door.
It's a large sunlit room.
A heavy car passes in the street
and makes the porcelain tremble.
I open door number two.
Freinds! You drank the darkness
and became visible.
Door number three. A narrow hotel room.
Outlook on a back street.
A lamp sparking on the asphalt.
Beautiful slag of experiences.
